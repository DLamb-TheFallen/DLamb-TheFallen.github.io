                        <h3>Java and SpringBoot</h3>
                        <p>I have the most experience programming in Java. It is probably the language I feel most comfortable in overall. I have experience in SpringBoot and am always looking to improve my skills with it. I like actually being able to make enterprise level backend applications.</p>

                        <h3>Python</h3>
                        <p>Python is what introduced me to programming and was the first language I started programming in. I would now say that python is the language I have the second most amount of time with and is what I'll use for more scripting purposes, especially cyber security related scripting. I also sometimes use it if I don't care about performance all too much and just want to make something quick.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>SQL (mySQL, PostgreSQL)</h3>
                        <p>I really enjoy working on the backend which of course means dealing with lots of data and databases. I have garnered quite a decent amount of experience with SQL and intend on incorporating in more and more of my projects in the future as I get more comfortable with it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>HTML, CSS, TypeScript</h3>
                        <p>I don't have the most adept knowledge or experience working with this development stack as I do prefer working on the backend. Sadly, you do need something for users to interact with for many applications and therefore I must implement a frontend to make use of my backend work. Also just understanding more of the application process helps with things on the backend as well as security purposes</p>
